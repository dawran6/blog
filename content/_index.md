# Hi, my name is Daw-Ran

I'm a mid-level software developer currently based in the PDT (UTC-7)
timezone. [Clojure][1] is my favorite programming language, and [Emacs][2] my
favorite development environment. My career focus at the moment is in front-end
development with [ClojureScript][3] and [React][4]. I have also done works in
Python, Java, and JavaScript in the past.

When I'm away from my keyboard, I love playing tennis, brewing coffee, and
reading novels written by Brandon Sanderson.
