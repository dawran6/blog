Hi there, I'm a programmer currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Besides my passion for programming, I also love playing tennis, lifting,
brewing/roasting coffee, surfing, cooking, and reading Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels.
(Lately, I've been a bit into home fermentation. We'll see how it goes.)

Clojure is currently my favorite programming language, surpassing Python.
That's why you see a lot more Clojure blog posts these days.
I enjoy a lot to share my passions with others.

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter
