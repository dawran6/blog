Hi there! My name is Daw-Ran.
I'm a professional software developer currently based
in the PDT (UTC-7) timezone.
Clojure/Script is currently my favorite tech stack.
That's why you'll find me posting quite a lot of blog posts
about Clojure lately.
I have also done works in Python, Java, and JavaScript in the past.

When I'm not at work, I love playing tennis, bouldering,
tasting coffee, and reading epic fantasy novels.

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter
[@dawranliou](https://twitter.com/dawranliou).
