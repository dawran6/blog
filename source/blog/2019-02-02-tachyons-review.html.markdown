title: Tachyons CSS Framework / Library Review
tags: css
---

I've tried to learn many CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, and Bulmar)
over the years. They never really clicked and styling felt just as painful
as ever. But this has changed since I learned about [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/).
First introduced by [Martin Klepsch](https://twitter.com/martinklepsch),
I learned and started to use Tachyons since late 2018 for the [Cljdoc.org](https://cljdoc.org/)
project [1]. This is the only CSS framework / library that fit my brain and my workflow.
If you are struggling with learning any CSS framework, I hope I could shed some lights
by introducing you Tachyons.

## Tachyons

Instead of a CSS framework, I consider Tachyons a CSS library.
Here's the marketing pitch from Tachyons'
[Github page](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/):

> _Functional css for humans.
> Quickly build and design new UI without writing css._

So what's functional css? Here I quote the explaination from the article
[In defense of Functional CSS](https://www.mikecr.it/ramblings/functional-css/)
by [Mike Crittenden](https://twitter.com/mcrittenden):

> _Functional CSS basically means that you have a ton of tiny,
> single purpose classes that are named based on their visual function._

Here's the definition from [John Polacek](https://twitter.com/johnpolacek)'s
[Letâ€™s Define Exactly What Atomic CSS is](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/):

> _Atomic CSS is the approach to CSS architecture that favors small,
> single-purpose classes with names based on visual function._

There seems to be a theme around "small," "single-purpose," and "visual" here.
But why are small and single-purpose important for CSS classes? It's because it makes
them highly __composable__. And the visual aspect makes the composable classes
very __readable and maintainable__.

In the rest of the post, I'll explain why composibility and maintainability
make Tachyons a great fit for my brain and then why it fits my workflow.
You can also find Tachyons' creator, Adam Morse, talk about his creation
if you'd like to learn his point of view[2].

## Composability matters

Coming into CSS with functional programming background, it really troubles me
that all the CSS classes are effectively global-mutable object. Without a good methodology
adopted by the developer, like [BEM](http://getbem.com/), all CSS classes have
side-effect on the whole document. (See example 1.) This makes containing
any CSS class a goal (See example 2.)

(Example 1)

(Example 2)

The two problems aren't problems for a seasoned CSS developer / team who are rigorous
about their methodology. However, I consider those incidental complexities and are
the major reason that shied me away from CSS.

Tachyons (and other functional css) addresses the two composibility problems above.
_(Though not entirely, but I'm very happy that very little of the time I have to worry
about them anymore. I'll explain more about what could still fail in the next section.)_
Consider the examples above with the functional CSS aproach:

(Example 3)

(Example 4)

What we got is the freedom of
