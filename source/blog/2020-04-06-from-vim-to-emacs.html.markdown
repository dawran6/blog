I was a Vim user a couple years back.
I totally loved (and still love) the philosophy of Vim
as well as the `hjkl` navigation. In contrast, Emacs didn't make any
sense to me. `C-v` for page down and `M-v` for page up? Does that even
make any sense to anyone?

Yet here I am, after all those years,
writing this article on my Emacs with all the keybinding craziness.
I must confess, I enjoy Emacs a lot.
