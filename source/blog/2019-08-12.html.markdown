When I first started using re-frame, I was a bit confused about what
effects and co-effects are, or, what `fx`'s and `cofx`'s are.
The explaination on the official documentation is certainly good,
and you certainly want to start there. However, if you find yourself
need a concrete example to help you understand them, please read on.

## The example - Firebase authentication

```clojure
(reg-event)
```

## Event

> Events are normally triggered by and external agent: the user
> clicks a button, or a server-pushed message arrives on a websocket.

## Effects

> About 10% of the time,event handlers need to ause side effects.

## Coeffects

> Event handlers compute how the world should change in response to
an event and, to do that, they need to first know the current state
of the world.

`coeffects` is the current state of the world, as data, as presented
to an event handler.
