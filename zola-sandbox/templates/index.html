    Hi there, I'm a programmer currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
    Besides my passion for programming, I also love playing tennis, lifting,
    brewing/roasting coffee, surfing, cooking, and reading Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels.
    (Lately, I've been a bit into home fermentation. We'll see how it goes.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Clojure is currently my favorite programming language, surpassing Python.
    That's why you see a lot more Clojure blog posts these days.
    I enjoy a lot to share my passions with others. 
  </p>

    Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/dawranliou">@dawranliou</a>.
