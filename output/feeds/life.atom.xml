&lt;p&gt;I challenged myself to read 10 books this year and I ended up reading 40 of them. Phew.
What a great year, 2016! I really picked up this new-found habbit of reading.
Feel free to add me friends on &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62701324-daw-ran-liou"&gt;Goodread&lt;/a&gt;
to see which book I'm currently reading. Let's read more! Here's my top 5 picks in 2016:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mistborn: The Final Empire (#33)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft Skills - The Software Developer's Life Manual (#2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 4-hour Work Week (#29)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Martian (#14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ready Player One (#15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Lean Startup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt the-lean-startup" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333576876m/10127019.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I've been exposed to the "lean" concept a lot from day to day. When I 
read the book, it wasn't a big surprise to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Soft Skills - The Software Developer's Life Manual&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt soft-skills" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1419180921m/23232941.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE single most influential book to me. This book talks every aspect of life but
software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Flask Web Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt flask-web-dev" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390432971m/18774655.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book really gives me a great foundation of developing Flask app. Before I 
read this book, I was jumping around the online tutorials but they didn't work out for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt win-firends" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442726934m/4865.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another very influential book. This classic book helps me to improve
my social life and my friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. The Millionaire Real Estate Investor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt millionaire-real-estate" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1417407442m/136205.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great investment book. Not only did it change the way I thought about 
investing in real estate, but also give you a concrete plan for investing. 
However, the concrete plan part of the book is kind of hard to digest for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The War of Art&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt war-of-art" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388176109m/1319.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This classic book helps me to understand one of my worst enemy - 
procrastination. However, reading the book was like being lectured, which I 
don't typically enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt ben-franklin" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428170518m/52309.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Franklin is such a fascinating person that I need to read his 
autobiography to know him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Rich Dad Poor Dad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt rick-dad-poor-dad" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388211242m/69571.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another very influential book that changed the way I think about money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. The Power of Habit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt power-of-habit" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1366758683m/12609433.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habit is one of the most important that dominates our daily lives without being 
notice. To understand it and be able to change it is so powerful that benefits 
all aspects of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. Think and Grow Rich&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt think-grow-rich" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463241782m/30186948.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic book. It's amazing how often I heard about this book from various 
people. The book's content is too hard for me to digest. Need to read it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;11. You are a Badass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt badass" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1351539051m/15843166.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very motivating and fun book. Love yourself and others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12. The End of Jobs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt end-of-jobs" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438463792m/25827122.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this book! It changed a lot how I think about career. Its 
target audience it not specific to software engineers (unlike Soft Skills, my 
bible) so go read it everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;13. Year of Yes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt year-of-yes" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1443552148m/25690958.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shonda Rhimes told about the amazing story of her Year of Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;14. The Martian (2nd time!)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt martian" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413706054m/18007564.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the FIRST EVER book that I read twice in such a short period of time. 
This book is witty, is fun, and is full of science! If you like the movie you'll
definitely enjoy the book, I promise! Some of the best parts are in the book 
only. This is definitely one of my all-time favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;15. Ready Player One (2nd time!)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt ready-player-one" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1406383612m/9969571.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the SECOND EVER book that I read twice in such short period of time. 
It's full of imaginations and excitements! I enjoyed every moment reading it. Of
course it's one of my all-time favorites too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;16. Pitch Anything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt pitch-anything" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347796457m/10321016.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the audio book version of it. It's always enjoyable listening to the 
author reading his/her own book. A lot of parts in the book is sort of 
irrelevant to me, but some of the pitches he made were just so crazily 
enchanting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;17. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt hitchhikers-guide" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327656754m/11.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classic sci-fi book. I don't always get its jokes but it's a fun read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;18. So Good They Can't Ignore You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt so-good-they-cant-ignore-you" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1360564614m/13525945.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this book even though I haven't finished it. This book breaks
the wide-spread "follow your passion" mindset about our dream jobs. Instead, it 
focused on the craftsmanship mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;19. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt 7-habits" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1421842784m/36072.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the best self development books I’ve read and the lessons I 
learned from it really apply to everyone. In stead of thinking in efficiency, 
this book focuses on the ‘effectiveness’ of the work you do. It’s a subtle mind 
shift, but it definitely helped making the decisions for where should you put 
the energies in. Even after fist published 25 years ago, the advices are still 
so relevant these days. No wonder this is a classic book of its genre. I love 
this book and bought a hard copy with me for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;20. How to Talk to Anyone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt how-to-talk-to-anyone" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388184197m/35210.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fun read but not so much I could grabbed on after reading it. The book’s 
goal is to bridge the gap where Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence
People, which published 80 years ago, didn’t tell the people living in the 21st 
century what to do. I love hearing about all the fun stories in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;21. The Like Switch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt like-switch" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1421037599m/21412226.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this book better than How to Talk to Anyone, even though the feelings 
I had to this book is somewhat similar to the other. It might be because the 
author was a former FBI agent and the stories was much more intrigue to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;22. Quiet - The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt quiet" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328562861m/8520610.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never felt so much connection to a book. This is yet another phenomenal 
book I’ve read. I learned so much about myself after reading it. I feel so much 
appreciation for Susan Cain, the author, for putting up the effort researching 
about the topic that’s so relevant to half of the population in this world. This
book has saved me from being doubt about a big part of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;23. Lean in&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt lean-in" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1364250803m/16071764.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great book that I think everyone should read. To me the book is about 
understanding, and supporting each other. Not only it’s applicable for female, 
but also the minority groups. Learning from Sheryl Sandburg’s marriage, I am 
more certain than ever that parents could both be successful in their career and
also have a great family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;24. Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt hackers" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435697935m/56829.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the history of generations of hackers is like THE history of computer. 
It was the hackers that drove the entire computer revolutions. (&lt;em&gt;Respects&lt;/em&gt;) I’d 
like to recommend this book to anyone who’s in the software/computer industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;25. The Personal MBA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt personal-mba" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348014445m/9512985.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a technical backgraound, I know so little about business side and this book
is perfect for peoople like me to start thinking in business. Now I need to turn
those knowledges into actions. Recommend to all the tech fellows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;26. Getting to Yes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt getting-to-yes" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442289862m/313605.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek mutual benefits and always aim for win-win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;27. The Hard Thing about Hard Things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt hard-thing" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386609333m/18176747.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book's first part tells the CRAZY startup story of Ben Horowitz. Reading
his words, I was so terrified and yet amazed by all the things he'd been through.
In the rests of the book, Ben explained what the hard things are and what he'd
learned from it. I am full of respect to the author and anyone starting a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;28. The Richest Man in Babylon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt richest-man-in-babylon" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348336780m/1052.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full of wise thoughts about personal finance. My favorite quote is &lt;em&gt;"A part of what
I earned is mine to keep."&lt;/em&gt; Pay yourself first when you get the paycheck, instead of
paying the merchants. Financial education is so important yet totally missed-out in
our education. Glad that I start gaining more knowledge about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;29. The 4-hour Work Week&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt 4-hour" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1394578573m/6444424.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorites. I can't tell you how much my mind was blown by this book.
Recommended by my brother, I read this book back-to-back twice and wished every word
would be memorized by heart.
"The End of Jobs" tells the importance of having one's own business, and this book
tells you exactly how. This is THE book that completely change the course of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;30. The Willpower Instinct&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt willpower-instinct" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436737104m/10865206.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding what willpower is and how does it work have such an impact to my life.
Willpower is like superpower that we all have. Understand it and utilize it properly
makes us all superheroes. &lt;em&gt;(Side note: I was reading the Mistborn trilogy on the side
while reading The Willpower Instinct. A fun idea came to me. The willpowers are like
Mistings' Allomancy powers. Every time you draw willpower to face challenges, you
burn a bit of your willpower reserves away. There're certain way you can do to recharge
willpower, but if you don't use them wisely, they'll be burned out very quickly.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;31. Trump: The Art of The Deal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt the-art-of-the-deal" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442705949m/1032.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get's a sneak peak into Donal Trump's mind. This person is a great businessman with
a great mind. I'm giving him more respect after reading this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;32. The E-myth Revisited&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt e-myth-revisited" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435673032m/81948.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great companion book for The 4-hour Work Week. This book explained about the
"E-myth", the Entrepreneur Myth, for most technician-changed entrepreneur. The product
of a business isn't the real product of an entrepreneur. It is the business itself that is the
real product of an entrepreneur. The product of business is just a bi-product of good
business. There's a distinction between good product and good business. Good product
does not necessary lead to good business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;33. Mistborn: The Final Empire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt mistborn-1" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1314601971m/6547258.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt this is the my favorite novel of the year! OMG I've never enjoyed a novel this
much, and yet this is my very first book in the high-fantasy genre. I'll definitely read
more fantasy books in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book completely blew my mind away! That was the most satisfying reading experience one could get. 
Brandon Sanderson is a genius. The fantasy world he created was simply amazing - its well-thought
magic system was the reason I first start reading the book but it was the characters and the twisted 
plots that stopped me from putting it down! It's full of tensions and OMG-that-did-not-just-happened 
throughout the book. I literary cried at a very emotional moment. I never cried over a book before. 
That how great it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the longest book I read in ages but I totally enjoyed every minute of 30 hours. 
I just can't wait to reading the rest of two books of the trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;34. A Brief History of Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt brief-history-of-time" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333578746m/3869.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot most of the Quantum Mechanics and General Astronomy I learned in College.
But this is a very good introductory book for understanding those concepts plus more
contemporary science that's not covered in college curriculum. I was listening to
audio version of this book and I just didn't have time to let the concepts sink in.
Still, the book is fun and reminds me of the amazing mother nature. Or the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;35. Redshirts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt redshirts" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348617890m/13055592.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo winner! It was a fun and casual book. It has very interesting prospect of the
science fiction world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;36. Speaker for the Dead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt speaker-for-the-dead" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1295660894m/7967.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second book of The Ender Quintet. This book felt so different from Ender's Game.
It has so much more depth in emotions and morals. I still like Ender's Game more, but
not because this book isn't great. Speaker for the Dead is just too overwhelming to
me to grasp. Likely I'll revisit this book in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;37. The 10X Rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt 10x-rule" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1310779133m/10339170.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set your goal to incredibly high and take massive action towards it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;38. A Monster Calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt a-monster-calls" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1474081871m/28588061.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very beautiful story about facing death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;39. Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt grokking-algorithms" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1458747997m/22847284.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this algorithm book! Especially the part explaining dynamic programming. 
All the illustrations are beautiful and feels very friendly, which makes an algorithm
book much more intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;40. 台灣不教的中國近代史&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt modern-history-china" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1426748118m/25173379.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我最喜歡的部份是蔣中正的故事。蔣中正在中國近代史中是滿爭議的人物，所以我很想多了解這個人。
作者出生在中國大陸、經歷過文化大革命，後來到日本定居。從他的角度說了蔣中正是怎麼崛起、抗日、
敗給中國共產黨。不論他對後世的影響，我很佩服蔣中正做事的決心、打仗的謀略、跟面對高壓環境的
能力。我比較驚訝的是抗日之後，他幾乎像是性情大變，形勢錯估得離譜然後就輸得一塌糊塗。不知道
是我看錯他的個性還是抗日改變了他。書的其他部分還滿有趣的但我沒有很喜歡作者敘事的語氣，滿多
時候帶了太多個人情感。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;41. Code Name Verity (still reading)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt code-name-verity" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1373223199m/16250900.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A beautiful story about friendships. Still reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book"></category></entry><entry><title>Completed my first hackathon!</title><link href="http://localhost:8000/first-hackathon.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-03-10T10:20:00-08:00</published><updated>2016-03-10T10:20:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Daw-Ran Liou</name></author><id>tag:localhost,2016-03-10:/first-hackathon.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was such a blast!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt hackathon" src="/images/hackathon.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was such a amazing experience. There’s no such thing that make you,
and your teammate pull a all-nighter and still gives you one of the
best times of your life, except hackathon. (Hackathon rocks!) I want to
share with you what it was like, if you don’t already know, and some
thoughts about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My company started its first ever hackathon last Thursday at 8 am. 
All submission were done on Friday, 12 pm and the whole afternoon is
for presentations and demonstrations. The basic idea of hackathon: 
it is a project competition that’s done during days of marathon-like 
intensive working/hacking. Participating teams get unlimited supplies 
of coffee and red bulls. Indeed this sounds very terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I use the word “hack” it is not exactly the same thing we pictured 
of what computer hackers do. For here it is more generic. Hacking is 
“to interact with a system in a way that the system don’t want you to.” 
For example, to gain access to another person’s online credentials without 
permission. Obviously, in usual use cases, the system wouldn’t want you to. 
Another example, to write a backdoor in your company’s commercialized 
software even though your company does not allow you to. Yeah, these are hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the hackathon, not only did our team hacked a backdoor in the system, 
but also did we hacked the system software architecture (a little) in order 
to get our parasite-like software running on top of it. I believe we had 
embraced the true spirit of hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those did not really matter. &lt;strong&gt;The biggest enemy in hackathon&lt;/strong&gt;, in my opinion, 
&lt;strong&gt;is perfectionism&lt;/strong&gt;. The 80–20 rules works very well here — &lt;em&gt;if you can make 80% 
of the things to work with 20% of the efforts, why spending the rest of the 80% of
time?&lt;/em&gt; If spending 20 mins hacking the system could get the software to work, why 
spend the extra hour or so? That’s what we ended up doing a lot through the hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this isn’t my first ever hackathon I’ve attended. However, this is the 
first ever hackathon that I finished. The difference is, I didn’t understand my 
tools well enough the previous time so I ended up spending a lot of time on the 
web searching for answers I should’ve known by the time. This time was different. 
I gain much more experience in building Flask web app throughout the course of 
past few months. Knowing my tools well enough, I’ve built-up the necessary coding
muscle memory that I don’t need to consult the documents so often. This gave me 
the edge to be able to construct my idea into code more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit about my hackathon project: the software stack I’m using is Python 
Flask for backend, and my crappy Bootstrap skills for frontend. The project idea is to
build a automated task scheduler web service on top of the existing system. Writing 
the web service wasn’t the hardest. The most difficult challenge is to integrate 
the web service into our existing system. OMG, I can’t tell how much relief it 
felt to see those pieces working together for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very proud of what my team had achieved in the hackathon. However, there’s one 
thing till today I still think that I could have (and should have) done better is 
the demo. I admit that we didn’t put too much thought into the demo. All I think 
was that we were going to BLOW EVERYONE’S MIND just by showing it. Turned out it
didn’t. Our way of presenting the software wasn’t very engaging to the judges. If
I could go back in time to where we started the hackathon, I would’ve punch in my
nerdy face and told him to sit down and think about the demo. Think about what 
you want to present in the demo. And be focused on making that happen. Everything
else is the extra 80% burden that drags you along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how things are so clear afterwards. I got two lessons learned in the end:
1. Know your tools well — go build up the coding muscle memory!
1. Design for demo — keep demo in mind all the time!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>How I wake up 2 hours earlier every day and become happier</title><link href="http://localhost:8000/morning-routine.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-27T10:20:00-08:00</published><updated>2016-01-27T10:20:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Daw-Ran Liou</name></author><id>tag:localhost,2016-01-27:/morning-routine.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My morning routines&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt morning-routine" src="https://tombasson.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/morning-routine.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here’s how I kick off my workdays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6:00 AM:
the alarm went off.
I allowed myself to stay in bed 5 more minutes to
skim through my phone notifications and
got up to do the 8 mins abs workout on my yoga mat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6:15 AM:
I went to the bathroom to take a hot shower,
and 5 minutes later, was looking in the mirror brushing
my teeth (and also do some other stuffs I can do
without clothes in the bathroom, like, shaving.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6:40 AM:
I drizzled some oil on the hot pan and started
frying an egg for my power breakfast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7:00 AM:
took a moment to enjoy my power breakfast with
a cup of fresh made pour over coffee. (Mmmmmmm.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7:15 AM:
sit back at my desk and started my morning learning session.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9:00 AM:
time to hit the road! Great, the traffic is calmer now.
I shall be in the office by 9:50.
[Press the play button on my favorite Podcast]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was nothing like the person described above at all three months ago.
What I’d like to tell you is the story of &lt;strong&gt;the routine I used to do
three months ago&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;what happens after adopting my new routine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit story about myself.
I’m a software developer working in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Like lots of people based in the Bay Area, we commutes!
And a lot!
The commute between my office and my place without traffic is
around 45 minutes oneway.
However, if you happen to be courageous enough to go on highway
during rush hour, guess what,
45 minutes is the time you spend stuck in the traffic with the
speed a dog can easily walk pass you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My old routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic is bad, so what? I avoid them.
To hit the road at 9 AM, I used to wake up 8:30 in the morning and
rushed out my door without eating breakfast.
Like everyone else who enjoys sleeping and believe me I still am,
I need at least 7 hours of sleep every day in order to gain enough
energy for a day of work plus my noon workout routine (this is another story).
So at this period of time, I went to bed around 1 AM, typically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now looking back, I was consistently feeling pressures from
work and life because I felt my free time was shrinking so much by the commute.
Quite often I found myself working in my off time and
tended to stay up late just to get more free time for work and myself.
This system wasn’t working right for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any legit reason to set up my mind for this change.
It’s just one day I came up the crazy idea:
“I’m going to challenge myself to wake up at 6 everyday for
21 days in a row because it sounds a healthy thing to do.”
Just kidding, I was first inspired by this YouTube video —
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjDmhNBtEfU"&gt;How To Develop A Kick Ass Morning Routine | 5 Tips For Starting Your Day&lt;/a&gt;
. This video help me to gather some great ideas to design
my morning routine from this video.
I also made a mental note that if the challenge was completed,
I’ll hang on to it and see how long could the streak goes on. (It’s 81 days BTW.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My challenge started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get enough sleep,
I forced myself to go to bed earlier than before at 11 PM.
Like most challenges, &lt;strong&gt;you gotta push yourself and hang in there!&lt;/strong&gt;
The hardest part for me was the weekends.
While still going out late with friends I still need to wake up at 6
the next day because I don’t want to fail the challenge.
On the craziest weekend I was partying out till 3 AM for
two days in a row and still manage to go on a snowboard trip on the third day.
Man, good old days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get to bed by 11,
I made one of the best decisions ever since working —
not working after work hours.
Why?
Because I don’t have time after work anymore.
On a normal day, I took off at 7 and get home by 8.
After dinner, doing the dishes, cleaning up here and there,
and maybe some video games, it’s almost 10 PM.
Doing any sort of work an hour before sleep will
cause my brain not wanting go to bed in time.
Plus, with my extra 2 hours in the next morning I could catch them up later.
Someone would call me if it is THAT urgent.
My sleep quality boosted so much ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I’d do a quick workout, any sort of workout.
Since I’m already keeping a regular workout everyday at lunch time,
I found the best workout I could do is for my abs.
I tend to skip abs in my regular noon workout easily so
why not tackle it the first thing in the morning?
The last line sounds like an awesome gym motivation quote. Cool. [Self-five]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About my power breakfast,
there are three building blocks: proteins, carbs, and fruits.
An example of my breakfast is english muffin with a fried egg,
2 slices of turkey breasts, lettuce, half of a avocado,
lean cream cheese and 2 kiwis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More energy&lt;/strong&gt; —
I don’t have any scientific fact to back me up but
I feel much more energetic even with the same amount of sleep.
Rarely do I feel sleepy during the workday now
(except when my workout at noon is too intense.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More time on the right tasks&lt;/strong&gt; —
Instead of stuck in the traffic,
now I’m using the best part of my entire day (morning!)
to on the most valuable thing — learning (sometimes some urgent work).
Driving is just a break before working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less pressure&lt;/strong&gt; —
Instead of dealing with work late at night,
dealing them in the morning gives me much more control of time and
less pressure by the time I go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthier&lt;/strong&gt; — I’m eating proper breakfast everyday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To sum up all above, I’m a happier developer now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="life-style"></category></entry></feed>
