    <h3>1. The Lean Startup</h3>
<p>I think I've been exposed to the "lean" concept a lot from day to day. When I 
read the book, it wasn't a big surprise to me.</p>
<h3>2. Soft Skills - The Software Developer's Life Manual</h3>
<p>THE single most influential book to me. This book talks every aspect of life but
software development.</p>
<h3>3. Flask Web Development</h3>
<p>This book really gives me a great foundation of developing Flask app. Before I 
read this book, I was jumping around the online tutorials but they didn't work out for me.</p>
<h3>4. How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People</h3>
<p>This is yet another very influential book. This classic book helps me to improve
my social life and my friendships.</p>
<h3>5. The Millionaire Real Estate Investor</h3>
<p>This is a great investment book. Not only did it change the way I thought about 
investing in real estate, but also give you a concrete plan for investing. 
However, the concrete plan part of the book is kind of hard to digest for me.</p>
<h3>6. The War of Art</h3>
<p>This classic book helps me to understand one of my worst enemy - 
procrastination. However, reading the book was like being lectured, which I 
don't typically enjoy.</p>
<h3>7. The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</h3>
<p>Benjamin Franklin is such a fascinating person that I need to read his 
autobiography to know him.</p>
<h3>8. Rich Dad Poor Dad</h3>
<p>Another very influential book that changed the way I think about money.</p>
<h3>9. The Power of Habit</h3>
<p>Habit is one of the most important that dominates our daily lives without being 
notice. To understand it and be able to change it is so powerful that benefits 
all aspects of our lives.</p>
<h3>10. Think and Grow Rich</h3>
<p>A classic book. It's amazing how often I heard about this book from various 
people. The book's content is too hard for me to digest. Need to read it again.</p>
<h3>11. You are a Badass</h3>
<p>This is a very motivating and fun book. Love yourself and others!</p>
<h3>12. The End of Jobs</h3>
<p>I highly recommend this book! It changed a lot how I think about career. Its 
target audience it not specific to software engineers (unlike Soft Skills, my 
bible) so go read it everyone!</p>
<h3>13. Year of Yes</h3>
<p>Shonda Rhimes told about the amazing story of her Year of Yes.</p>
<h3>14. The Martian (2nd time!)</h3>
<p>This is the FIRST EVER book that I read twice in such a short period of time. 
This book is witty, is fun, and is full of science! If you like the movie you'll
definitely enjoy the book, I promise! Some of the best parts are in the book 
only. This is definitely one of my all-time favorites.</p>
<h3>15. Ready Player One (2nd time!)</h3>
<p>This is the SECOND EVER book that I read twice in such short period of time. 
It's full of imaginations and excitements! I enjoyed every moment reading it. Of
course it's one of my all-time favorites too!</p>
<h3>16. Pitch Anything</h3>
<p>I have the audio book version of it. It's always enjoyable listening to the 
author reading his/her own book. A lot of parts in the book is sort of 
irrelevant to me, but some of the pitches he made were just so crazily 
enchanting.</p>
<h3>17. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</h3>
<p>Classic sci-fi book. I don't always get its jokes but it's a fun read.</p>
<h3>18. So Good They Can't Ignore You (still reading)</h3>
<p>I highly recommend this book even though I haven't finished it. This book breaks
the wide-spread "follow your passion" mindset about our dream jobs. Instead, it 
focused on the craftsmanship mindset.</p>
<h3>19. Code Name Verity (still reading)</h3>
<p>A beautiful story about friendships. Still reading.</p>
<h3>20. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</h3>
<p>This is one of the best self development books I’ve read and the lessons I 
learned from it really apply to everyone. In stead of thinking in efficiency, 
this book focuses on the ‘effectiveness’ of the work you do. It’s a subtle mind 
shift, but it definitely helped making the decisions for where should you put 
the energies in. Even after fist published 25 years ago, the advices are still 
so relevant these days. No wonder this is a classic book of its genre. I love 
this book and bought a hard copy with me for reference.</p>
<h3>21. How to Talk to Anyone</h3>
<p>It’s a fun read but not so much I could grabbed on after reading it. The book’s 
goal is to bridge the gap where Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence
People, which published 80 years ago, didn’t tell the people living in the 21st 
century what to do. I love hearing about all the fun stories in the book.</p>
<h3>22. The Like Switch</h3>
<p>I enjoyed this book better than How to Talk to Anyone, even though the feelings 
I had to this book is somewhat similar to the other. It might be because the 
author was a former FBI agent and the stories was much more intrigue to me.</p>
<h3>23. Quiet - The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking</h3>
<p>I’ve never felt so much connection to a book. This is yet another phenomenal 
book I’ve read. I learned so much about myself after reading it. I feel so much 
appreciation for Susan Cain, the author, for putting up the effort researching 
about the topic that’s so relevant to half of the population in this world. This
book has saved me from being doubt about a big part of myself.</p>
<h3>24. Lean in (Translation: 挺身而進)</h3>
<p>This is a great book that I think everyone should read. To me the book is about 
understanding, and supporting each other. Not only it’s applicable for female, 
but also the minority groups. Learning from Sheryl Sandburg’s marriage, I am 
more certain than ever that parents could both be successful in their career and
also have a great family.</p>
<h3>25. Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</h3>
<p>Reading the history of generations of hackers is like THE history of computer. 
It was the hackers that drove the entire computer revolutions. (<em>Respects</em>) I’d 
like to recommend this book to anyone who’s in the software/computer industry.</p>
